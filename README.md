🚦 Traffic Analysis Dashboard
This project is a real-time traffic monitoring and analysis dashboard that visualizes traffic patterns using live data from APIs.
It helps understand congestion levels, identify high-traffic areas, and analyze trends to improve transportation planning.

We built it using Tableau for interactive visualizations, Python for data processing, and Google Sheets + Geoapify API for live location-based traffic data.

✨ What it can do
Shows real-time traffic data on an interactive map.

Highlights high-congestion zones and traffic flow patterns.

Displays key metrics like average speed, congestion index, and road usage.

Allows filtering by city, date, or time to explore trends.

🛠 Tech we used
Tableau – Dashboard creation and visualizations

Python – Data processing and API integration

Google Sheets – Live data storage & sharing

Geoapify API – Location & traffic data

CSV/Excel – For historical datasets

🚀 How to try it yourself
Open the Tableau dashboard file (Traffic_Analysis.twb or .twbx)

Connect it to your own Google Sheets / CSV data source

Replace the API key with your own Geoapify API key

Refresh the data and explore the visualizations

👨‍💻 Team behind this project
Laxman Reddy – Data collection, API integration, Tableau dashboard design

We made this project to learn how to combine live API data, data processing, and visual analytics for real-world decision-making.
It’s simple, scalable, and can be adapted for traffic management, city planning, or navigation tools
